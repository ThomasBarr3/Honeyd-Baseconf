# Honeyd Base Configuration File

This file provides a basic configuration for Honeyd, a tool used to create virtual honeypots on a network. It defines default actions for various protocols and sets up a sample "windows" profile.

## Configuration Overview

**1. Default State:**

- The `create default` line creates a default profile that applies to all connections unless overridden by specific profiles.
- Subsequent lines set default actions for TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic within the `default` profile:
    - `set default default tcp action block`: All incoming TCP connections are blocked.
    - `set default default udp action block`: All incoming UDP connections are blocked.
    - `set default default icmp action block`: All incoming ICMP (ping) requests are blocked.

**2. Windows Profile:**

- The `create windows` line creates a profile named "windows" for simulating a Windows system.

**3. Windows Profile Configuration:**

- `set windows default tcp action reset`: Incoming TCP connections within the "windows" profile are reset. This might mimic the behavior of a Windows system rejecting unauthorized connections.
    - Consider using a more specific action like `loglocal` or `redirect` to capture connection attempts and potentially redirect them for further analysis.
- `set windows ethernet "00:80:64:**:**:**"`: Sets the MAC address for the "windows" profile. Replace the asterisks `*` with desired values.
- `bind 192.168.0.1 windows`: Binds the "windows" profile to the IP address `192.168.0.1`. Adjust this address if needed for your network configuration.

## Customization

- This is a basic configuration. You can customize it by adding more profiles for different types of honeypots you want to simulate.
- Refer to the Honeyd documentation for detailed information on available options and configuration directives: https://honeyd.org/documentation/configuration/

## Important Note

Blocking all traffic by default might be too restrictive depending on your use case. Consider carefully what types of traffic you want to allow or redirect based on your honeypot goals.

## Security Considerations

- Using a honeypot can attract malicious actors. Ensure you have appropriate security measures in place to monitor and respond to any potential threats.
